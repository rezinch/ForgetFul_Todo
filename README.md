### Project Description

Forgetful Todo‚Ñ¢ is a dynamic, AI-powered to-do list application that helps you forget your tasks. Instead of a static list, your tasks will subtly mutate and evolve over time, drifting away from their original intent until they become something entirely new.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Normal to-do lists are boring.. So what do you do.. You modify them.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

You create a to-do list that changes overtime and makes things more confusing.

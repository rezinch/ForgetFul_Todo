### Project Description

Forgetful Todo‚Ñ¢ is a dynamic, AI-powered to-do list application that helps you forget your tasks. Instead of a static list, your tasks will subtly mutate and evolve over time, drifting away from their original intent until they become something entirely new.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

The modern world is filled with overwhelming to-do lists that create stress and a crushing sense of responsibility. The constant pressure to remember and complete tasks is a significant source of anxiety. What if, instead of remembering, we could embrace the art of forgetting?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We've built an "anti-productivity" tool. Forgetful Todo‚Ñ¢ actively helps you forget your tasks. Using a generative AI backend, the app periodically "mutates" your to-do items into related but different tasks. With features like "Mutate All" and a persistent "Auto-Mutate" toggle, you can watch your responsibilities delightfully transform into amusing nonsense, freeing you from the burden of ever getting anything done.
